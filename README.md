# Random-number-generator
Letâ€™s see how to get a random number between 1 and 100 in python 3 using the random module.

The randint() function of the random module returns a random number between two given numbers. To get a random number between 1 and 100, pass 1 and 100 as the first and second arguments, respectively.


#!/usr/bin/python3
import random

random_number = random.randint(1, 100)
print(random_number)

The above Python code will return a random integer between 1 and 100 each time you run the program (including 1 and 10).
